			<h2><u>Past Work Experience</u></h2>
			<h3><u>Seasonal work 2015-present: <i> Floral Sculpture</i></u></h3>
			<blockquote>During the busy times like Christmas, Valentines and Mothers Day, I help Floral Sculpture get through their work load. While working there I prepare the flowers and materials and I make bouquets and arrangements. I assist on deliveries to shops, home deliveries and weddings. I have gained a valuable understanding of how to deal and treat customers.</blockquote> 
			<h3><u>Christmas Transition Year Work Experience: <i>Primary School</u></i></h3>
			<blockquote>I helped the students with any difficulties in class and I helped teach the children their school work. As this school is very small(approximatley 40 students), there were 4 classes for one teacher to manage. As a result of this, I was capable of taking some of the stress off the teachers. I supervised the school yard at lunch times.</blockquote> 
			<h3><u>Summer Transition Year Work Experience: <i>CMC Calnan Accountants</u></i></h3>
			<blockquote>I sorted and organised files. I logged clientâ€™s information into the computer system and I completed two official VAT returns.</blockquote> 
			<h3><u>2018 June-December <i>Unit One Coffee Shop</u></i></h3>
			<blockquote>At Unit One Coffee Shop, I made and served customers coffee and food. Within a short few weeks of being trained in, I was given my own set of keys and was trusted to run the coffee shop by myslef. I got a chance to learn how to work independently and built up friendly relationships with customers.</blockquote> 
			<h3><u>2019 June- August: <i>Dinos Restaurant</u></i></h3>
			<blockquote>At Dinos Restaurant, I worked as a waitress. I took customers orders as well as serving them their food. I was trusted to open and close the restaurant while i was working there. I gained a lot of valuable lessons working as a waitress, like how to communicate with customers and meet their demands.</blockquote>
			<h3><u>2019 August- present: <i>Centra</u></i></h3>
			<blockquote>Currently I am working in centra as till and floor staff. While behind the tills, I scan customers products and charge them. On the floor, I clean the shop as well as stock shelves.</blockquote>
